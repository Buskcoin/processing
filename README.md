Roombaide
==========

This is the official source code for the [Roombaide](http://iaroc.org) Development Environment (RDE).
This is a fork of Processing intended to be used to control create 2 robots and is very much a work in progress.

__Please help.__
The instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/roombaide/roombaide/wiki/Build-Instructions).
Please help us fix problems, and if you're submitting code, following the [style guidelines](https://github.com/roombaide/roombaide/wiki/Style-Guidelines) helps save us a lot of time.

__And finally...__
Someday we'll also fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and get rich off all this stuff that we're giving away for free. But not today.

So in the meantime, I ask for your patience,
[participation](https://github.com/roombaide/roombaide/wiki/Project-List),
and [patches](https://github.com/roombaide/roombaide/pulls).
